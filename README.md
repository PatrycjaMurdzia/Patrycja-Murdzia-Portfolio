# Patrycja-Murdzia-Software tester Portfolio
**Hi there** 👋
My name is **Patrycja**, I am an **aspiring Software Tester** who loves making sure software works well and is easy to use. I am learning by working on **practical projects, practicing manual testing, reporting bugs,** and understanding **how software works**.
**Why testing?** During my **UX/UI design course**, I noticed that **I naturally spot errors** and **recognize** when **something doesn’t work as it should**. That’s why I decided to start a **QA course** and now **the knowledge from both fields helps me a lot in testing**.
